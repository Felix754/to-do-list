            <h2> Welcome to my To-Do List!</h2>
            <p>
                This tool is designed to help you stay organized and manage your tasks and projects efficiently.
                With a clean, user-friendly interface, the To-Do List allows you to create, view,
                and manage your projects and tasks all in one place.

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>
                The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Projects and tasks are stored in the browser`s local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.
                The interface adapts to both light and dark themes based on user preference.
                Semantic HTML elements are used to enhance the structure and accessibility of the application.
            </p>
